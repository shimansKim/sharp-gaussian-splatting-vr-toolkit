// Thermal-adaptive quality controller (ADR-0009). It moves one index along a measured ladder of
// contribution-cull thresholds so that a frame-rate target holds without reaching thermal
// throttling. Pure policy: the host samples the platform (frame intervals, GPU timestamps, the
// Android thermal headroom forecast, the GPU clock), feeds one QualitySample per rendered frame
// and applies the returned rung. The same object replays a recorded bench CSV offline
// (`splatconv replay`).
//
// Two loops:
//  * Frame guard (fast). A one-second window is bad when more than 10 % of its frames missed the
//    target interval, the GPU time averaged at least 90 % of it and the GPU clock was at least
//    0.9 of its maximum: the GPU was the bottleneck with no clock headroom left, not a CPU or UI
//    hitch or the governor's choice of clock (ADR-0011: in hand-held use a fifth of the frames
//    were late at every rung and clock). Step down when 4 of the last 6 windows were bad:
//    governors also drop the clock for 1-3 s now and then and every frame misses meanwhile
//    (seen in recorded runs on both phones, ADR-0009), while a rung that cannot hold the target
//    misses window after window.
//  * Thermal loop (slow), on the 30 s headroom forecast. Step down when the forecast reaches the
//    LIGHT threshold minus ~0.5 C and is still rising over the last 60 s, at most once per 60 s
//    after any step: skin temperature answers a power change only over minutes, so a faster loop
//    would keep stepping while heat from earlier frames arrives. Step up when the forecast and the
//    current headroom are both ~2.5 C below LIGHT, the current rung's dwell has passed and the GPU
//    clock is below 60 % of its maximum: the forecast extrapolates a falling skin, so alone it
//    can call a phone cool that is not (ADR-0011). A step up that is undone within 600 s - the
//    skin's fast response plus the slow drift that carries a failed step up over the band -
//    doubles the dwell of the rung it left.
//    Forecasts from the platform forecaster's first 20 s are not used: it fits its slope to as few
//    as three one-second skin samples, so one 1 C sensor step reads as +15 C in 30 s.
